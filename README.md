# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explores the **Requirement Analysis phase** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It is developed as part of the **ALX FeatureForge Project**, focusing on designing a clear and structured foundation for a **Booking Management System**.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate how to:

- Gather, document, and analyze requirements.
- Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements.
- Create use case diagrams.
- Define clear acceptance criteria for system features.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project.  
It ensures that the development team fully understands what the system must achieve before implementation begins.

It is one of the most critical stages of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** as it forms the foundation for design, development, and testing.

Key objectives include:

- Understanding user needs and business goals.
- Translating these needs into functional specifications.
- Defining system boundaries and constraints.
- Ensuring alignment between stakeholders and the development team.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential in ensuring project success.  
Here are three key reasons why it matters:

1. **Clarity and Alignment:**  
   It bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and developers by translating vague ideas into actionable requirements.

2. **Reduced Project Risks:**  
   Clear requirements minimize misunderstandings, rework, and project delays.

3. **Better Resource Planning:**  
   Knowing what is required allows for accurate time, cost, and manpower estimations.

4. **Improved Quality and User Satisfaction:**  
   When software meets exact user expectations, it enhances satisfaction and trust.
