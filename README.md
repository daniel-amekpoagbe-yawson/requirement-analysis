# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explores the **Requirement Analysis phase** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It is developed as part of the **ALX FeatureForge Project**, focusing on designing a clear and structured foundation for a **Booking Management System**.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate how to:

- Gather, document, and analyze requirements.
- Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements.
- Create use case diagrams.
- Define clear acceptance criteria for system features.
